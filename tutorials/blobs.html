		<h2 id="page-subtitle">Having blobs saved is a requirement to the downgrade process.</h2>
		<p>To preface: blobs are the response signature from Apple telling your device that a restore is valid. Certain tools allow you to save that response so it may be used at a later time. There are infinite use files, meaning that you can restore with the same blob several times.</p>
		<h3>Let's save some blobs!</h3>
		<p>One of the most common and highest recommended tools is <a href="https://tsssaver.1conan.com/">TSSSaver</a> by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/1Conan/">1Conan</a>. It backs your blobs up to its own servers, and allows you to easily import them to Dropbox and Google Drive, as well as downloading them in a ZIP archive.</p>
