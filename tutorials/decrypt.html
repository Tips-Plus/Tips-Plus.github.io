	<h2 id="page-subtitle">IPSW decryption can be used to restore system files</h2>
	<p>An IPSW file is the operating system image for iOS devices. You use these to restore within iTunes or through third party tools like FutureRestore. Think of them like an iOS equivalent to a Windows ISO.<br>Within IPSW files are the system file structure. This is incredibly helpful in the case of accidentally deleting a system file or folder.</p>
	<p class="highlight-warn">If you have deleted a system file or folder, do not reboot or respring! This could cost you your jailbreak! If deleted via Filza or iFile, first attempt to locate it within the trash and restore it!</p>
